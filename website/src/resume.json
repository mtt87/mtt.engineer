    "summary": "I'm a self-taught software engineer with over 14 years of experience. I work best with TypeScript across the full stack while specializing in the frontend where I've been using React for years. I'm the type of engineer that thrives at the intersection of product and code. I genuinely enjoy talking to users, understanding their problems and shaping solutions that address real needs. In my spare time I'm always trying to find new ways to use my Raspberry Pis. I'm a big fan of home automation, monitoring bots and building a little cluster as home lab.",
